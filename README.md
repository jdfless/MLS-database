For this project I created an MLS database that includes all the teams, players, coaches, and stadiums as well as tables to hold previous teams for players and coaches.
This project involved the creation of this database as well as a web page for viewing and modifing the database which was written with html, javascript/jQuery and php. Looking back at the web page the style is not nearly up to my standards now, but it is functional. One obvious and simple improvement would be to use AJAX to eliminate unnecessary page reloads.
As of January 2015 the page is still active but may be removed by Oregon State (who was my host while enrolled there) at any time as I have now graduated.
